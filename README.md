# Interactive Button Flask App

This is a simple Flask application to serve the interactive button webpage.

## Setup and Running

2. Install Flask by running: `pip install flask`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`
4. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

## How it Works

- The Flask app serves your index.html page
- The button clicks are stored in your browser's localStorage
- The counter will persist between page refreshes
